I'm Vignesh Arumugam, I'm cheerful to express about myself - as a dedicated and detail-oriented Quality Assurance professional with 1.3 years of experience, I have gained a good knowledge in ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience in creating and executing test plans, identifying and reporting bugs, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to improve software performance. I am proficient in using testing tools and frameworks like - Tricentis Tosca, Selenium with Java, TestNG, POM etc. 

I found myself increasingly drawn to the creative and technical challenges of web development, leading me to make a strategic shift in my career towards web technologies. This transition has been driven by my passion for building dynamic, user-centered web applications. I have honed my skills in front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. My QA background uniquely positions me to build high-quality web applications, as I bring a strong focus on testing, performance optimization, and ensuring user experiences.

While my journey in QA has provided me with a strong technical foundation, I am now fully immersed in the world of web development. I am eager to apply my combined knowledge of QA and web technologies to create innovative, scalable, and user-friendly web solutions. My goal is to contribute to projects where I can leverage both my attention to detail and my passion for coding, ultimately delivering high-quality products that exceed user expectations.

Key Tools: AWS, GIT, JIRA
